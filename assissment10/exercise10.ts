// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
//If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
//just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

import inquirer from "inquirer";

// we simply make two variable
let name =  "khalid"
 let surname = "ali"

// this  step join the name and surname
 let fullname= name+surname

// and finally this print full name
 console.log(fullname)
